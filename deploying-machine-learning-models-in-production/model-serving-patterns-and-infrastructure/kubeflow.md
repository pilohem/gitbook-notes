# Kubeflow

Kubeflow is basically Kubernetes applied to Machine Learning systems.

From [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org) site:

> The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Our goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures. Anywhere you are running Kubernetes, you should be able to run Kubeflow.
