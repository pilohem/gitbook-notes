# ðŸ˜Ž Deploying Machine Learning Models in Production

{% hint style="info" %}
**Disclaimer**: The content in this repository has been developed for educational purposes only. The majority of the content is based on the [MLOps Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) Specialization series, especially course 4, and most of the images are obtained from the course slides notes available on the [deeplearnig.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai) site.
{% endhint %}

The main purpose of this repository is to have some references on the main topics seen during the course. There is a lot of information shown and it can be a little confusing at the beginning. The content presented is not exhaustively described (for that you should go to the course itself), but I think it summarizes the platforms and tools discussed during the course.
